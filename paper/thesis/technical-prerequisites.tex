\begin{itemize}

\item CPU: \JWPLcpu{} (\emph{Sandy Bridge}\cite{wiki:snb} microarchitecture)

\item Motherboard: \JWPLboard{} (using an external video controller)

\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The most evident characteristics of the \JWPcpu{} are the four cores (on one
chip) and the uniform distribution of the caches (see figure
\ref{fig:cache-orga}). All caches except for the last--level cache (L3) are
present on each core \cite{fog11}. The CPU's \emph{performance monitoring unit}
(PMU) appears---because of its central importance---in a separate chapter
(\ref{sec:pmu}). A short overview of the key features follows
\cite{intel2011spec}:

\begin{itemize}

\item Number of cores: 4

\item CPU clock speed: \SI{3.4}{\giga\hertz}

\item L1 cache of \SI{64}{\kibi\byte} per core\cite{intel2011softdev1}

\item L2 cache of \SI{256}{\kibi\byte} per core\cite{intel2011softdev1}

\item shared L3 cache of \SI{8}{\mebi\byte}\cite{intel2011softdev1}

\end{itemize}


%-  PMU  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Performance Monitoring Unit}
\label{sec:pmu}

The CPU's \emph{Performance Monitoring Unit} (PMU) is present since the
Intel\TReg{} Pentium processor. This unit is able to monitor several of the
CPU's performance parameters while the system is running. Originally meant for
tuning system and application performance \cite{intel2011softdev3b}, it is
mostly used by compiler developers.

In prior work \cite{bellosa2000benefits,snowdon2010operating,
weissel2002process,kellner03tempcontrol,bertran2010decomposable} some of these
performance events have proved to be somehow related to the power consumption of
the CPU. The selection of the events and the degree of their correlation to
energy highly varies among CPUs, or at least CPU microarchitectures.
Therefore, that has been done again for the Intel\TReg{} Sandy Bridge
microarchitecture and in particular the \JWPcpu{}.

Examining the processor user's manual \cite{intel2011events}, approximately 184
events have been found available and usable. Because the CPU is only able to
count eight (four in Hyper--threading \cite{wiki:HT} mode) user--programmable
performance events simultaneously \cite{intel2011softdev1} the most useful
events have to be selected. In addition to the eight (four) events, the CPU
provides three counters for fixed events, which will be counted anyway:
\JWctr{CPU\_CLK\_UNHALTED.REF\_TSC}, \JWctr{CPU\_CLK\_UNHALTED.THREAD} and
\JWctr{INST\_RETIRED.ANY}.

The selection, configuration and usage of these performance event counters is
done via special \emph{model specific registers} (MSRs)
\cite{intel2011softdev3b}. In this work a more high--level approach via the
\JWpn{perf\_event}-API (unofficial documentation at
\cite{weaver2011perfevents}) of newer Linux Kernels and \JWTlibpfm{} (see
chapter \ref{sec:standard-software}) has been used.


%-  architectural differences  -------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Architectural Differences among Sandy Bridge and its Predecessors}

The Intel\TReg{} \emph{Sandy Bridge} microarchitecture is a further development
of the Core and Nehalem architectures \cite{fog11}. Among other simplifications
of the branch prediction unit, the special loop predictor has been discontinued
presumably to reduce the overall pipeline length and to minimize the
misprediction penalties \cite{fog11}. For speed--improvements a micro--operation
($\mu$op) cache and macro--operation fusion have been introduced \cite{fog11}.
