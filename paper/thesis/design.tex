\end{figure}

As figure \ref{fig:overview} illustrates an additional workstation---the
\emph{Examining Workstation (EW)}---has been used while evolving this thesis.
The \emph{System under Test (SuT)} counts the CPU's performance events itself
and the EW records the energy consumption using a measuring device in the
meantime. These two data sets have thereafter been used to build up the energy
model.


%#  MEASURING SETUP IN DETAIL  #################################################
\JWltwo{Measuring Setup in Detail}
\label{sec:measuring-setup}

To fit the energy model later, the current flows of the CPU and the
motherboard's \SI{12}{\volt} supply have to be measured. Using four--terminal
sensing \cite{wiki:FTS} voltage drops across the sensing resistor are
measured to deduce the current flow. The motherboard's \SI{12}{\volt} current
flow has been measured in this thesis because it was unclear if the CPU is
entirely fed by its own \SI{12}{\volt} power supply.

Because the SuT and the EW (see figure \ref{fig:overview}) have to agree about
the examination (time) interval a trigger wire is used. It is realized as a
simple analog signal using the parallel port's \emph{high} and \emph{low}
voltages.

This can be summed up to measure three potential differences. Since the
measuring device (chapter \ref{sec:measuring-device}) provides up to eight
differential, analog input channels this seems easy at first. Unfortunately,
two caveats apply: On the one hand according to the user's manual
\cite{NIManual2009} the best measuring accuracy can be achieved in range of
\SI{-200}{\milli\volt} and \SI{200}{\milli\volt}. On the other hand the overall
potential differences may not exceed $\pm$\SI{10.4}{\volt} \cite{NISpec2009}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/potential-equalizer.eps}
  \caption{Potential equalizer}
  \label{fig:potential-equalizer}
\end{figure}

Choosing adequate sensing resistors for the \JWchan{CPU} (R =
\SI{10}{\milli\ohm}) and \JWchan{BOARD} (R = \SI{5}{\milli\ohm}) channels (see
figure \ref{fig:circuit}) worked out well. The parallel port trigger wire has
been a problem at first, though. The parallel port has a potential difference
range of more than \SI{200}{\milli\volt} and our test machine's port had a very
different potential level than the \JWchan{CPU} and \JWchan{BOARD} channels,
exceeding the allowed range of $\pm$\SI{10.4}{\volt}.  The potential equalizer
illustrated in figure \ref{fig:potential-equalizer} solves both problems.

Finally, three differential channels \JWchan{CPU}, \JWchan{BOARD}
(\SI{12}{\volt} supply only!) and \JWchan{TRIGGER} in the range of
$\pm$\SI{200}{\milli\volt} and alike potential levels can be connected to the
measuring device. The performance events get counted on the SuT itself which
controls the trigger wire, too: The trigger is set to \emph{On} directly before
executing the program to examine and is set to \emph{Off} promptly after its
termination. To safely register all CPU energy consumption peaks, a high
sampling rate of \SI{50}{\kilo\samples\per\second} is chosen. An exemplary
plot of an examination can be found in figure \ref{fig:cpu-power-trig}.

\label{sec:measuring-device}

For measuring the voltage drops \JWPLni{} from
\JWenterprise{http://www.ni.com}{National Instruments} (shown in figure
\ref{fig:ni}) was chosen because it supports high sampling rates of up to 250000
samples per second (\SI{250}{\kilo\samples\per\second}) and is very accurate
(accuracy $< \SI{2.69}{\milli\volt}$)\cite{NISpec2009}.

%#  CALCULATION OF THE ELECTRICAL WORK  ########################################
\JWltwo{Calculation of the Electrical Work}
\label{sec:calc-work}

From elementary physics

\begin{eqnarray}
     U_R & = & R * I \\
  \iff I & = & \frac{U_R}{R}
\end{eqnarray}

and

\begin{equation}
  U_{CPU} + U_{R} = 12 V
\end{equation}

we obtain the instantaneous power of the CPU by measuring the voltage drop
across the sensing resistor:

\begin{eqnarray}
P_{CPU}(t) & = & (12V - U_R(t)) * \frac{U_R(t)}{R} \\
           & = & \frac{12V * U_R - {U_R}^2}{R} \\
           & \stackrel{0 < U_R \ll 1}{\approx} & \frac{12V * U_R}{R}.
\end{eqnarray}

Hence, integrating will result in the electrical work

\begin{equation}
  W = \int P_{CPU}(t)dt.
\end{equation}


%#  ENERGY MODEL  ##############################################################
\JWltwo{Energy Model}
\label{sec:model}

The following chapters will define the term \emph{energy model} along with  the
formal methods suggested to build such a model.


%-  the model's properties  ----------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Properties}
\label{sec:model-properties}

In this work, an energy model is considered as a linear formula. A system with
$N$ cores that is able to monitor $M$ performance events per core
simultaneously is described. Additionally to the per--core event counters, $K$
global event counters make the model up. In the formal description (see chapter
\ref{sec:towards-the-model} for the practical implementation) we assume four
functions providing the actual values:

\begin{itemize}

\item $g(k)$ the global event $k$'s count in the observed period of time

\item $c(n, m)$ the performance event $m$'s count in the observed period of time
      on CPU/core $n$

\item $w_g(k)$ the global event $k$'s weight in \si{\joule}

\item $w_c(n, m)$ the weight of performance event $m$ in \si{\joule} on core
$n$

\end{itemize}

Though, a energy model equates to

\begin{equation}
W = \sum\limits_{k=0}^K g(k) w_g(k) +
\sum\limits_{n=0}^N \sum\limits_{m=0}^M c(n, m) w_c(n,m)
\end{equation}

The functions $g$ and $c$ contain the system's life data whereas the energy
weights $w_g$ and $w_c$ can be calculated a priori as done in this work.
Obviously the selection of the events and their respective weights highly depend
on the type of microprocessor.


%-  minimizing the counter set  ------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Minimizing the Set of Performance Events}
\label{sec:min-events}

Having seen  what exactly constitutes an energy model (chapter
\ref{sec:model-properties}), it is crucial to find a small and significant set
of performance events to use. It is not practical to take into account all
events the microprocessor is aware of. Today's processors offer a lot more
events then they can count simultaneously \cite{intel2011softdev1}.

The approach to find a reasonable subset of $N$ events (of $A$ available) used
in this work can be summed up to:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Generation of the matrix of performance event counters $C$ and
the corresponding vector of electrical works $W$

\item Obtaining $C'$ containing the $N$ most correlating columns of $C$

\end{enumerate}

Thereafter, the system of linear equations

\begin{equation}
W = C' * X
\end{equation}

can be solved by simple linear regression.


\JWlfour{Step 1: Generating $C$ and $W$}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Choose $p$ test programs which use the CPU differently. The test
programs have to be independent from external events. We consider subsequent
runs of a test program as equal.

\item Divide the $A$ available events in $g$ disjoint, non--empty sets
$E_{1..g}$ of size up to $N$.

\item For each set $E_{1..g}$, run all the $p$ test programs and record the
electrical work and the event counters of the set's events.

\item The electrical work of each of the runs of a test program should be
roughly equal.

\item Folding all the results leads to a vector $W_{1..p}$ containing the
electrical work a run of each of the test programs consumes. Additionally, a
matrix $C = [c_{1..p,1..N}]$ arises, containing each event counter's value for a
run of each of the test programs.

\end{enumerate}

\JWlfour{Step 2: Deriving $C'$ from $C$}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Add all columns from $C$ to $C'$

\item Eliminate duplicate columns in $C'$

\item Eliminate columns which contain only zeroes in $C'$

\item Eliminate linear dependent columns in $C'$

\item \JWtodo{weiter}
