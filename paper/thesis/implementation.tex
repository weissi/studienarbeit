%#  DATA FORMATS  ##############################################################
\JWltwo{Data Formats}
\label{sec:data-formats}

This chapter will give a rough outline of the formats used to store data between
the various phases of the analysis. The lingua franca for most complex on disc
formats are the schrieblesque \JWTprotobuf{}. Though, when interfacing with
external software such as \JWTR{}, other formats had to be chosen. The choice in
favour of Protocol Buffers has been made because of \emph{think XML, but
smaller, faster, and simpler} (which is incidentally their  slogan).

%-  shot ids  ------------------------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Shot IDs}
\label{sec:shot-ids}

A shot ID (shot identifier) is a string value uniquely identifiying one
measuring experiment. More precisely it's a character string containing only a
defined set of ASCII characters. The following regular expression shoud match
all valid shot IDs: \verb%[a-zA-Z0-9@_-]{1,64}%.

Such shot IDs are always used to associated power and performance event
measurings.


%-  voltage drop data point files  ---------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Electrical Power Data Point Files}
\label{sec:datapoint-files}

The main matter of the \emph{electrical power data point files} (called
\emph{data point files} for simplicity) is to log the CPU's power consumation by
time. As described in chapter \ref{sec:measuring-setup}, voltage drops are
measured and electrical power and work are calculated later on. This is
why data point files do literally contain voltage drop values by time.
But since the only reason they exist is to serve as calculation input later on,
they are named after their future meaning.

For practical reasons the representation is designed rather flexible: It
supports arbitrary sampling rates, an arbitrary number of (named) channels and
high-resolution timestamps (up to \SI{1}{\nano\second}).

While doing the research for this thesis, three channels have been recorded with
a sampling rate of \SI{50}{\kilo\samples\per\second}: \texttt{CPU} -- the CPU's
voltage drops, \texttt{BOARD} -- the mainboard's voltage drops (unused) and
\texttt{TRIGGER} -- the trigger cable used to mark the periods of time the
other machine counted performance events.

The data point files are also one notable exception of the \emph{Protocol
Buffers for everything} principle in this work. Procotol Buffers were not
designed to handle large messages but are great as individual messages
\emph{within} a large data set \cite{google11pbtechniques}. So (as you can see
in appendix \ref{sec:fmt:datapoints}) small Protocol Buffer messages are
streamed one after another. The size of one of these chunks is not specified.
Usually one makes up a chunk when he receives one from a measuring device. The
rule of thumb is: Make them as large as practical, but not too large since we
only record one timestamp per chunk. The data points inside each chunk are
considered as distributed equally.


%-  performance counter files  -------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Counter Files}
\label{sec:counter-files}

The \emph{counter files} are used to save the performance event counter values
after the completion of one measuring experiment. Having the performance event
counter's values and the electrical work of one measuring experiment is an
essential part toward calculating an energy model (see chapter
\ref{sec:towards-the-model}). The match of corresponding data point files
(chapter \ref{sec:datapoint-files}) and counter files is done using the shot ID
(chapter \ref{sec:shot-ids}).

The counter files' on-disc representation is -- except for some magic bytes --
a Protocol Buffers-only format. For the technical definition see appendix
\ref{sec:pb:counter-files}.


%-  work files  ----------------------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Work Files}
\label{sec:work-files}

The content of the work files is just the electrical work of a certain
measuring experiment in Joule. The file format is the ASCII representation of a
floating point value followed by optional garbage (separated by an ASCII space
or newline). In contrast to the other file formats, the work file's file names
have to match the following format: \verb%work_<SHOT-ID>_.work% (e.g.
\verb%work_SPEC-gcc@2011-08-31_16-07-46.work%).

The following listing shows a valid work file:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Shell]
$ hexdump -C work_SPEC-gcc@2011-08-31_16-07-46.work
0000  37 34 2e 30 31 35 32 35  36 0a   |74.015256.|
000a
\end{lstlisting}




%#  TOOLS  #####################################################################
\JWltwo{Tools}
\label{sec:tools}

Since the building of a reasonable energy model is not an easy task, numerous
tools have been used. Most of the tools were developed specifically for the
purpose of this study thesis. All of them are open-sourced and available on
\JWnamedlink{https://github.com/weissi/studienarbeit}{GitHub}
(\JWlink{https://github.com/weissi/studienarbeit}).

\end{itemize}


%-  special developments  ------------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Special Developments}
\label{sec:special-developments}


\JWlfour{\JWTlibdp}

\JWTlibdp{} is responsible for loading and saving the measured data points from
and to the data point files (see chapter \ref{sec:datapoint-files}). It's API is
straight forward and the library is able to handle arbitrarily large files. The
API can be found in \JWpath{libdatapoints/datapoints.h}.


\JWlfour{\JWTfcw}

\JWTfcw{} can calculate the electrical work from data points files quickly.  As
explained in section \ref{sec:calc-work} it integrates the instantaneous power
to electrical work.  But since we obtain discrete data by sampling (see section
\ref{sec:measuring-setup}), the integration can be done quite fast:

\JWtodo{integral P = sum P * diff}

The following example illustrates the usage of \JWTfcw{}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Shell]
fastcalcwork captured-17:15:00.dpts CPU 0.01 TRIGGER
\end{lstlisting}

Using the command line above, \JWTfcw{} will calculate the electrical work with
a measuring resistor of \SI{0.01}{\ohm}. The measured data points will be taken
from column \texttt{CPU}, the analog trigger's (see section
\ref{sec:measuring-setup}) value from \texttt{TRIGGER}.


\JWlfour{\JWTdc}

\JWTdc{} is a tool for retrieving the performance event's counter values on
the target machine. Giving it a set of performance events and a command to
execute, it will record the events while the task is running. It always works
system-widely and saves values by counter and by CPU enabled. Along the way it
also controls the trigger cable (see chapter \ref{sec:measuring-setup}).  That
is crucial to be sure examining the same time intervals for counting performance
events and measuring electrical power.

A working example executing \texttt{/bin/ls} and counting
\JWctrCLK{} and \JWctrINST{} along the way:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Shell]
dumpcounters -e CPU_CLK_UNHALTED,INST_RETIRED \
             -o ls_clock-cycles_inst-retired.ctrs \
             -r /bin/ls
\end{lstlisting}

After the executing, the file \texttt{ls\_clock-cycles\_inst-retired.ctrs} will
contain the performance event counters' values. The file format is described in
chapter \ref{sec:counter-files}.


\JWlfour{\JWTde}

\JWTde{} exports data point files (see section \ref{sec:datapoint-files}) to
\JWTR's \texttt{read.table} format \cite{r11data}.


\JWlfour{\JWTdd}

\JWTdd{} is the tool used to dump the measuring data to data point files (see
chapter \ref{sec:datapoint-files}). It currently records the three channels
\texttt{CPU}, \texttt{BOARD} and \texttt{TRIGGER} with a sampling rate of
\SI{50}{\kilo\samples\per\second} using \JWTnidaqmxbase{} (see chapters
\ref{sec:standard-software} and \ref{sec:measuring-device}) to a file.
Again, the usage is quite simple and straight forward:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Shell]
datadump out.dpts my-shot-id
\end{lstlisting}

The sample would save the measuring experiment \texttt{my-shot-id}'s data to the
file \texttt{out.dpts}. The record would run until a \texttt{SIGINT} signal is
caught. Optionally a third parameter representing the desired maximal running
time in seconds is supported.


\JWlfour{\JWTcbs{} suite}

\JWTcbs{} suite is a frontend making it easy to write and use
microbenchmarks.  It was primarily meant to stress inividual performance event
counters, hence its name. Because, in the end, this tool was not used to
gain the results, it is not described in depth. Working samples can be found in
the directory \JWpath{ctrbenchmark/benchlets/}.


\JWlfour{\JWTbsle}

\JWTbsle{} is a \JWnamedlink{http://haskell.org}{Haskell} program which is able
\emph{build} the \emph{s}ystem of \emph{l}inear \emph{e}quations. It takes
several counter files (\ref{sec:counter-files}) and the corresponding work files
(\ref{sec:work-files}) as input and outputs a system of linear equations.

Given that \JWTR{} was always used to post-process the results of \JWTbsle{}
it's obvious that, again, \JWTR's \texttt{read.table} \cite{r11data} format is
outputted.


\JWlfour{high-level scripts}

As one could understand so far, there are many simple tools. To compose
the ensemble many of these have to be invoked correctly with each other. Since,
this is not a trivial task, some high-level scripts have been developed. Most
notably \JWTdomeasuring{}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Shell]
$ do_measuring.sh -f \
                  -s 2011-09-09_15-41-32 \
                  -p demo-shot \
                  -o /tmp/demo-shot \
                  i30pc59 \
                  'CPU_CLK_UNHALTED,INST_RETIRED' \
                  /bin/ls
No other 'datadump' running: OK

GREAT SUCCESS, EVERYTHING WENT FINE :-)

%#  TOWARD THE ENERGY MODEL  ###################################################
\JWltwo{Toward the Energy Model}
\label{sec:towards-the-model}

In this chapter a description of the steps toward the final energy model(s) is
given.


%-  BENCHMARKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{The set of Benchmarks}
\label{sec:benchmarks}

The first step toward the energy model is to choose a good set of benchmarks.
The benchmarks should stress different parts of the CPU and should collectively
stress all parts and units of the CPU. As chapter \ref{sec:restrictions} states
some units have been deliberately excluded in this work. The benchmarks should
therefore avoid the excluded units because their results would then have a bad
consequences on the final model.

The benchmark choice fell to the \JWTLspec{} suite, the memory bandwith
benchmark \JWTLstream{} a benchmark provokating many branch mispredictions
and an ALU stress benchmark.

For the multi-core tests, different instances of these benchmarks have been
pinned to each core and were therefore running simultaneously.


%-  SUBSET OF USEFUL COUNTERS  -------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Finding a useful Subset of Events}
\label{sec:finding-useful-subset}

Because of the symmetric architecture of the CPU (see chapter
\ref{sec:sandy-bridge}) the final subset of events in the model has been
gathered using only one enabled core of the CPU. The other cores have been
disabled using the BIOS.

To model the baseline energy of a core (the energy consumed when no performance
event is triggered), one pseudo--event per core (modelling the time it is
enabled) has been added. These events fall in the group of the \emph{global
events} (see chapter \ref{sec:model-properties}). A core can only be enabled or
disabled when the machine gets (re)booted. Therefore each of these
pseudo--events is either $0$ (core \emph{disabled}) or equal to the
entire running time of a benchmark (core \emph{enabled}).

The general methodology has already been described in chapter
\ref{sec:min-events}.  First the performance events were randomly
distributed in disjoint groups of eight events which is the maximal number of
performance events the CPU can count simultaneously (see chapter
\ref{sec:sandy-bridge}). Thereafter, for each group of events all benchmarks
have been executed consecutively. Then all the runs of each benchmark were
considered as one run recording all available events. Since the electrical
work consumed and the running time was recorded for each run of its own they
were averaged per benchmark. Attention was payed that the averaged values didn't
differ much between the runs, the relative standard deviation was below 4\% in
the worst case.

The result was considered as one huge system of linear equations and the best
subset of events was chosen using \JWTleaps{}. The events \JWctrCLK{} ($=$
\JWctr{CPU\_\-CLK\_\-UNHALTED.\-THREAD} $\propto$
\JWctr{CPU\_\-CLK\_\-UNHALTED.\-REF\_\-TSC}) and \JWctrINST{} ($=$
\JWctr{INST\_\-RETIRED.\-ANY}) are counted using fixed counters (see chapter
\ref{sec:pmu}) and were therefore forced into the model. Except the two fixed
counters, \texttt{leaps} has been configured to find the best model for eight
counters.

Appendix \ref{appendix:chosen-events} describes the events forming the energy
model presented in this paper.


%-  FINAL MODEL  ---------------------------------------------------------------
\JWlthree{Final Energy Model}
\label{sec:final-model}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/run-benchmarks.pdf}
  \caption{Run Benchmarks}
  \label{fig:run-benchmarks}
\end{figure}

After the event selection process energetical weights for the (pseudo-)event had
to be found. To find these, the benchmarks runs were repeated -- once again on
a single core but recording all of the final events in one shot. Thereafter all
reasonable permutations for two and three cores and 500 random permutations for
all four cores have been generated.  This new large set of benchmarks has then
been executed, always rebooting and reconfiguring the machine to the correct
number of enabled cores. Figure \ref{fig:run-benchmarks} illustrates the
process. The pinning of the benchmarks to their target core has been done using
the \texttt{taskset} utility.

Presumably due to symmetric architecture of the CPU, the event's energetical
weights proved to be similar on all cores. Hence, the model's general form could
be simplified. Consequently the function $w_c$ is not anymore parametrized by
core. The following equation shows the new form, identifiers as in chapter
\ref{sec:model-properties}.

\begin{equation}
W = \sum\limits_{k=0}^K g(k) w_g(k) +
\sum\limits_{m=0}^M  w_c(m) \sum\limits_{n=0}^N c(n, m)
\end{equation}

The table shows the energetical weights which form the functions $w_g$ and
$w_g$. $g$ and $c$ are the system's live data mainly available from the CPU's
performance event counters. The formula above and the weights below are the
energy model presented in this thesis. That is enough to estimate the
electrical power the CPU consumed in a selectable time interval.
